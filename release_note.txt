V3.4 (2013-11-28)
	Live track features
		Features are duplicated from TDManagement software
		Communicate with a program named "AVL Service" for all live track information. Ask Tongrui Zhang for details about this software. I do not maintain this software.
		Each browser tab (window) use one live track session and has its own auto-report settings.
		Support live view over internet (mobile), by click "Live View" button to download a .dpl file and open it with "DVRViewer".
	Add channel selection on web playback

	
V3.3 (2013-11-1)
	Fix play list file https error
	Add on web video file playback (Not official feature)
		It is hidden by default, to enable it, set $webplay_support to 1 in config.php, load "videos" page, search and select one video, click "Preview Video Clip".
		This is clips based video play, total depends on web browser support for back back controls.
		MP4 format only for HTML <video> tag. Would works on windows, androids devices.  Almost all recent browser should work.  ( for IE, please update to version 10 ) (Firefox also works ^^)
		Trans-code on server, expect some delay when opening
		No audio, audio format on .266 are specific to TME, no chance to make it work except some one can ask the developer of .266
		No OSD, same reason as above.
		If video did not auto start or show error, try click reload.
		Again, this is not official feature, I only thought this could be cool and may be useful. ( Don't report as bugs if it doesn't work well, leave it hidden )
